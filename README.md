Adafruit_CC3000_Dynamodb
========================

This is a fork of Adafruit's and Tony Dicola's CloudThermometer demo sketch for writing thermometer
temperatures from Arduino over a CC3000 to Amazon's Dynamodb.

I've tried to extract it down to just the core essentials to use a library that can be included
in any sketch needing to write to Dynamodb. It would greatly benefit
from a LOT of code cleanup and refactoring.

See the [guide on the Adafruit learning system](http://learn.adafruit.com/cloud-thermometer)
for more more info on the original demo.
